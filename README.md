👋 Hello all! Welcome to our community for developing an open-source Meeting Bot API. Our goal is to empower developers and organizations with a flexible, self-hosted solution for meeting recording, transcription, and management across platforms like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. Here's how we plan to make it happen:

**January 2025** MVP Ready for Early Testing
Our priority is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our first community members to explore and build with:

🛠️ One-click deployment via Terraform for quick setup.\
📺 Compatibility with Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.\
🤖 Invite bots to meetings via an API call.\
📤 Pull meeting recordings (audio only) programmatically using API endpoints.\
⚙️ Basic functionality designed for prototyping and testing Proof-of-Concepts (POCs).\
*Note: These releases are for experimental purposes and not intended for production use.*

**February 2025** Usable and Secure Version
With MVP feedback in hand, we’ll focus on improving usability and security, making the bot ready for initial commercial applications:

🔒 API Key-based authentication for secure API usage.\
🔄 Callbacks to notify when meeting recordings are ready.\
📅 Support for scheduling bots to join meetings automatically via calendar integration.\
💻 Enhanced GUI for managing bots, managing integrations ect.\
*Note: Our goal is to introduce the first release suitable for production use.*

**March 2025** Feature Enhancements and Community Input
We're focusing on features that improve the bot's functionality and customization. We're also actively seeking community feedback and contributions!

🖼️ Custom profile photos for bots during meetings.\
🎥 Support for video recording alongside audio.\
⏲️ Real-time audio/video/transcription.\
🌐 Open discussions for additional feature requests from our community.\
*Note: Our goal is to ensure this project is ready for community supports. We hope to onboard developers to contribute to the project and help shape its future.*
